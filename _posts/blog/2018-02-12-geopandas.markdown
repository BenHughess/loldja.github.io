Get started with open-source spatial analysis in Python can be tricky. For one, there’s many possible libraries from which to choose, of varying and overlapping functionality but not enough cross-compatibility. Piecemeal and sparse documentation also remains a challenge, and most top blog posts for common questions on Google I’ve found to be using older code conventions.<!--more-->

This two-part article aims to get you started in an geodata-stack that is modern and works. [Part One](https://medium.com/@loldja/spatial-libraries-in-python-3-a-working-set-up-for-windows-59ba80407528) will walk you through installation on Windows. [Part Two](https://medium.com/@loldja/reading-shapefile-zips-from-a-url-in-python-3-93ea8d727856) more or less follows the example of Andrew Gadius’ blog on the same topic to give a real world example of downloading shapefile ZIPs from the web, but updates the code to more modern standards and dependencies that work with Python 3.
