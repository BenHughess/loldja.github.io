Last night I had the pleasure of attending Career Night at Metis NYC. The main event of the evening was a series of 4-minute final presentations by members of the eighth cohort to complete the flagship [12-week immersive data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com). <!--more-->Having met the presenters three months ago during the first week of the bootcamp, I was blown away by how much they had learned in this short amount of time. As a whole the presentations were strong, polished, creative, intelligent, and diverse in both methods and topics.

The following is a list of all presenters, links to their Github profiles, and a brief description of the project in order to get a sense of the types of skills one can acquire in this program. As with any bootcamp, what you put in is what you get out of it, but in my (humble, biased) opinion, Metis is the best one out there. <b>Congratulations new graduates!</b>
